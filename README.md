# What is ClEnSensors

ClEnSensor is a system integration project aimed to produce a DIY system enabling:
- monitor and report on the web the environmental status of a general purpose system, by means of sensors deployed on a wireless network
- control certain actuators either automatically (with trigger or threshold logic) or remotely via a web enabled management console
